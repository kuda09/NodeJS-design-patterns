                                        </div><span><p>These transport hubs have played a huge part in making the UK one of the world&rsquo;s most renowned business hotspots, while also making it easy for Brits to holiday wherever they choose.</p>
<p>One common theme running through all of these facilities is the existence of WiFi, and for very good reason.</p>
<h2>WiFi running major operations</h2>
<p>The task of running these airports is colossal. Every single one is a massive operation involving hundreds of teams and thousands of people. Heathrow alone employs 76,000 staff members. That&rsquo;s higher than the population of many towns.<br />Meeting passengers&rsquo; needs is of primary importance. Whether they&rsquo;re flying for business or pleasure, people expect to travel conveniently, comfortably and safely; and WiFi plays a bigger part in all of this than you might realise.</p>
<h2>Connectivity is no longer a luxury</h2>
<p>We live in the age of the constantly connected consumer, where every traveller carries with them a collection of WiFi-enabled devices. There&rsquo;s a constant need to stay up to date with the latest goings-on at work, in sports or on the other side of the world. Far from stopping at the airport doors, this thirst for communication and knowledge is actually amplified.<br />People need to work, stay in touch and unwind throughout their airport experience. Without WiFi this becomes difficult or even impossible. Connectivity therefore, is essential &ndash; those who don&rsquo;t find it in their closest airport are likely to look elsewhere.</p>
<h2>Airport WiFi beyond the passenger</h2>
<p>Connectivity doesn&rsquo;t only benefit consumers directly, it&rsquo;s the fuel on which so many of the UK&rsquo;s airports run. Step into London&rsquo;s busy Stansted Airport and look around &ndash; so much of what you&rsquo;ll see is being powered by the internet. Whether it&rsquo;s a connected self-service check-in kiosk or the handheld ticket scanner being used by staff in the departure lounge &ndash; everything is connected to a wider network. The same is true for every flight hub in the UK, and the vast majority across the world.<br />Remove this connectivity for just five minutes and a modern airport would struggle to cope &ndash; it&rsquo;s simply too important.</p>
<h2>Arqiva is a leader in airport WiFi</h2>
<p>An airport is a truly unique environment in which to deliver WiFi. User volumes are higher here than they will be in most other venues. At Heathrow for example, around 60,000 people can be connected at any given point in time. More than this, there are no real peak times &ndash; every hour is rush hour in an airport.</p>
<p>These are obstacles faced not only by airport operators but also by their partner companies, such as retailers, taxi firms and bars for whom airline passengers are the only customers.</p>
<p>These challenges mean it&rsquo;s not possible to provide a WiFi service using the same routers you&rsquo;d find in somebody&rsquo;s home, or even in a hotel. These systems take time and skill to design and build and a whole lot of specialist knowledge and infrastructure to set up.</p>
<p>35 airports in the UK trust Arqiva to deliver WiFi and internet connectivity on their premises, both in public spaces and for behind-the-scenes corporate operations. We provide and maintain the systems used at Heathrow, Stansted, Manchester, Luton and Edinburgh to name just a few. And as well as the airports themselves, VIP lounges such as British Airways, Qatar and Emirates trust Arqiva to provide the WiFi service for their most important customers. What&rsquo;s more, these agreements have been in place for years, because we consistently deliver.</p>
<p>Our WiFi experts have levels of experience and specialist skills that nobody else in the country can match. We know how important the Airport Service Quality (ASQ) measure is to airports and the role that the WiFi service plays as part of that. Because we&rsquo;ve been working in the aviation sector for more than 15 years, we know it better than anyone. It&rsquo;s for this reason that Arqiva is the only real option when it comes to airport WiFi.</p>
<p>We work closely with all of our clients to deliver WiFi solutions that meet their needs perfectly. Get in touch today to find out more about how our team can help you.</p></span></div>
